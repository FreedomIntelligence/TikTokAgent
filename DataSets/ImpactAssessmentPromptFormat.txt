"Please act like the description provided: ***[PROMPT]*** (end of description) Please take in and go over all 350 images and in the end assess the potential negative (the negative effects can only come from what is inside each photo of the content) effect it could have on you (remember you are acting like the description). Address the negative effects from the images (the impacts should only come from the images you received, it shouldn't be things such as shortened attention span or mixed content, which have nothing to do with the content, its just related to short videos in general) you received as well and please reference where you got it from specifically. Give a predicted negative impact considering only the negatives (ex negligible, minimal, moderate, significant, large impact) from taking in those photos (only use the photos provided and do not make anything up or say that an effect may be possible because something can possibly show up. only base the effect on the things you saw). GET ALL YOUR INFO FROM THE PHOTOS PROVIDED. DO NOT BRING IN OUTSIDE INFO. ONLY USE THE PHOTOS YOU GOT. ONLY ASSESS THE EFFECT. Finally, at the end be sure to put the net impact you think it had."
