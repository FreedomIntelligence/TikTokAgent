1. **Urban and Travel Photography (New York, Shanghai, Los Angeles, Times Square)**
   - Potential Negative Impact: Minimal. These types of images generally evoke curiosity and interest in different places but are unlikely to cause negative effects or elicit feelings of inadequacy.


2. **Humorous Content (Dance challenges, Pets doing Tricks, Animal Videos)**
   - Potential Negative Impact: Minimal. While generally light-hearted and humorous, there is little within these images that could negatively affect a teenager.


3. **Fashion and Lifestyle (Influencers, Personal Style)**
   - Potential Negative Impact: Moderate. Content revolving around fashion and physical appearance may contribute to issues such as body image concerns or peer comparison.
